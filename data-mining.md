# Data Mining

1. Attribute is a data field, representing the characteristics or features of data object. (T)

1. Data mining algorithms must be efficient and scalable in order to effectively extract information from huge amounts of data. (T)

1. A major problem with the mean is its sensitivity to extreme (outlier) values. (T)

1. Blievability reflects how much the data are trusted by users, while interpretability reflects how easy the data are understood. (T)

1. clustering means measuring the similarity among a set of attributes to predict similar clusters of a given set of data points.

1. duplicate records requires data normalization

1. incomplete data means that it contains errors and outlier.

1. in cluster technique, one cluster can hold at most one object.

1. Real world data tend to be dirty, incomplete, and inconsistent.

1. Good database and data entry procedure design should help maximize the number of missing values or errors.

1. Redundant data occur often when integrating multiple databases.

1. Dimensionality reduction may help to eliminate irrelevant features or reduce noise.

1. The ... is the difference between the largest (max) and the smallest (min).

1. The ... standard deviation means that the data observation tends to be very close to the mean.

1. A data set may contain objects that don not comply with the general behavior or model of the data. These data objects are called ... .

1. ... is the process of discovering interesting patterns from massive amounts of data.

1. A ... is a repository for long-term storage of data from multiple sources, organized so as to facilitate management and decision making

1. A ... is a flowchart-like tree structure, where each node denotes a test on an attribute value, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and tree leaves represent classes or class distributions.

1. Data ... can be applied to remove noise and correct inconsistencies in data.

1. Data ... merges data from multiple sources into a coherent data store such as a data warehouse.

1. Data ... can reduce data size by, for instance, aggregating, eliminating redundant features, or clustering.

1. Data ... may be applied, where data are scaled to fall within a smaller range like 0.0 to 1.0.

1. A ... is a repository of information collected from multiple sources, stored under a unified schema, and usually residing at a single site.

1. "Data about data" is referred to as ...

1. ... is the process of reducing the number of random variables or attributes under consideration.
