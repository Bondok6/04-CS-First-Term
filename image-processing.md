# Image Processing

1. Digitizing image intensity amplitude is called
   a) sampling
   **b) quantization**
   c) framing
   d) Both A and B

1. Compressed image can be recovered back by
   a) image enhancement
   **b) image decompression**
   c) image contrast
   d) image equalization

1. Image compression comprised of
   a) encoder
   b) decoder
   c) frames
   **d) Both A and B**

1. What would you use compression for?
   **a) Making an image file smaller**
   b) Modifying an image

1. Makes the file smaller by deleting parts of the file permanently (forever)
   **a) Lossy Compression**
   b) Lossless Compression

1. Makes the file smaller by giving repeated patterns/colors a specific code
   a) Lossy Compression
   **b) Lossless Compression**

1. Which file types use Lossy compression?  
   **a) JPEG, GIF**
   b) PNG, BMP

1. Which file types use Lossless compression?  
   a) JPEG, GIF
   **b) PNG, BMP**

1. Which of these is an advantage for Lossy compression?  
   **a) The file size becomes significantly (much) smaller**
   b) The file size does not become much smaller than 50%

1. Error of the image is referred to as
   A. pixels
   B. matrix
   C. frames
   **D. noise**
1. Reducing the data required referred to
   A. image enhancement
   **B. image compression**
   C. image contrast
   D. image equalization
1. Digitizing the coordinate values is called
   A. radiance
   B. illuminance
   **C. sampling**
   D. quantization
1. Black and white images have only
   **A. 2 levels**
   B. 3 levels
   C. 4 levels
   D. 5 levels
