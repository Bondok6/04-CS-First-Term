1. Noise reduction is obtained by blurring the image using smoothing filter.  
   a) True  
   b) False

   a) Median of pixels  
   b) Maximum of pixels  
   c) Minimum of pixels  
   d) Average of pixels

1. Smoothing linear filter is also known as median filter.  
   a) True  
   b) False

   Answer: b  
   Explanation: Since the smoothing spatial filter performs the average of the pixels, it is also called as averaging filter.

   b) Smooth transitions of brightness levels  
   c) Sharp transitions of gray levels  
   d) Sharp transitions of brightness levels

   Answer: c  
   Explanation: Smoothing filter replaces the value of every pixel in an image by the average value of the gray levels. So, this helps in removing the sharp transitions in the gray levels between the pixels. This is done because, random noise typically consists of sharp transitions in gray levels.

   b) Median filter  
   c) Sharpening frequency filter  
   d) Smoothing spatial filter

   Answer: d  
   Explanation: This is a smoothing spatial filter. This mask yields a so called weighted average, which means that different pixels are multiplied with different coefficient values. This helps in giving much importance to the some pixels at the expense of others.

1. The mask shown in the figure below belongs to which type of filter?  
   a) Sharpening spatial filter  
   b) Median filter  
   c) Smoothing spatial filter

   a) 3  
   b) 5  
   c) 9

   Answer: d  
   Explanation: We know that, as the size of the filter used in smoothening the original image that is averaging filter increases then the blurring of the image. Since the second image is more blurred than the first image, the window size should be more than 9.
